# DevOps Pipeline Project for WordPress & MySQL on Kubernetes

This repository demonstrates a complete DevOps pipeline that integrates:

- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline (with advanced stages including tests).
- **Ansible**: Automation for infrastructure provisioning and deployment.
- **Docker**: Containerization for WordPress and MySQL.
- **Kubeadm/Kubernetes**: A two-node cluster with a load balancer (MetalLB) for zero downtime.
- **VirtualBox & Ubuntu Server**: Local development and testing environment.

The WordPress application connects to a MySQL database to persist data.
